                    <p class="mb-5">With the advent of new technologies, mobile devices have become the preferred gateway for accessing the digital business world. In order to meet the growing expectations from the market, there is a need to embed into digital apps, advanced AI capabilities like Visual Recognition, Chatbots, etc. with compatibility across channels, easily. We wanted to build a desktop tool that would cater to these needs while letting developers build apps in a jiffy. The output: our new IBM Digital App Builder.</p>

                  <p>According to Gartner report 2018, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/citizen-developer/">Citizen developers</a> are users who have some technical background but are relatively new to the emerging digital app development landscape. They need tools with gentle learning curve and faster app development capability.</p>

                <p>This project had its genesis in an older IBM product which was a web-based Rapid Mobile App Developer(RMAD) tool. It assisted the enterprise mobile app developers to consume the services offered, by letting them integrate pre-built components such as using datasets, adding security into the mobile app being built. However, it was a small research project aimed at exploring the power of Low-code app builders and it had limited controls and capabilities that did not cater to a large audience. </p>
              </div>
              
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>The research started with finding answers to questions like What is mobile app developement? How does mobile app development happen in an enterprise? Who are the stakeholders involved in the process? What are the tools and services used while developing a mobile app?. To thus understand the gap in the offering, users and their needs and the product targets, I set out to conduct a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/" target="_blank">Enterprise Design Thinking</a> Workshop. 15 participants(Engineers, Managers, Designers, etc.) attended the workshop where we worked on the empathy maps and need statements, As-is scenarios, Big ideas and To-be scenarios and understood the user, his problems and his needs and goals and how to fulfil them.</p>

                  <p>The plan of designing the tool was based around the premise: Build a mobile app with AI, quickly. The workshop outcomes were Big ideas, which were charted into hills(project development targets). Our high level goals were:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Help build mobile apps for multiple channels, faster</li>
                      <li>Assist mobile app enhancement with AI, Data or Microservices, whenever needed</li>
                      <li>Maintain consistency with Mobile Foundation platform</li>

                  </p>
                    
                    <p>We started of with the ideas which were easily implementable and had the most impact on the problems. Starting with the pencil sketches of ideas, converting them to low-fi wireframes and testing them with the users gave us clarity on how the tool is actually being used or can be used and how to improve it. The learnings from the tests informed the future designs in the process.</p>
